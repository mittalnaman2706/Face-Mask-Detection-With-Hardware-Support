# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Hardware

## Project Purpose and Goal

The novel Coronavirus has devastated the world in the past couple of months. The pandemic has caused major destruction to the business, travel, and technology industries and has taken the lives of many people. Its imprint will forever be engraved in our history due to its worldwide impact. In order to mitigate these impacts, safety precautions must be followed and one of the major ones is wearing a mask. Therefore, the widespread use of masks will reduce the number of cases and deaths around the world. So, we came up with a way to solve thisâ€” a face mask detector. This system can be used in offices, schools, and stores where masks are mandatory. The machine, built from a CNN model, can differentiate between people not wearing and wearing a mask.

## About the Dataset:
The dataset is present in the 'dataset' folder and contains two folders in it:
1. with_mask: Having 1915 images in it
2. without_mask: Having 1975 images in it.

## How to run the code?:

1. Install Anaconda from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ : Installing Anaconda means you are getting a version of Python installed (Anaconda has Python + >450 modules)

2. Open Anaconda Navigator to download all the dependencies required for the project (all the requirements are listed under the project_requirements.txt file):
-> Just go to your directory in the Navigator, and run "pip install -r project_requirements.txt" command.

![Anaconda Prompt](https://github.com/piyushsharma220699/Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Hardware/blob/main/other_images/anaconda_prompt.png)

3. Then in Anaconda: 
Open Jupyter Notebook,
Go to creating_model.ipynb and run all the cells!
(This might take a few minutes to run the file and create the model)

## Special Thanks to Mrs. Padmavati, Assistant Professor, PEC for her guidance during the complete project!
